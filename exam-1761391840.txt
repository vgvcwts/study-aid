        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "According to Chapter 12, Potential Energy, potential energy is defined as the energy that can be stored in a system when certain types of forces act between its components. Conservative forces are those that can be expressed as the negative gradient of a potential energy function.",

            "reasoning": "The passage correctly explains that potential energy arises from conservative forces. Conservative forces are those whose work depends only on initial and final positions, allowing the definition of potential energy as stored energy due to their presence."
